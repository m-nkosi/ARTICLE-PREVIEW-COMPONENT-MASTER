## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [JQuery](https://jquery.com/) - JS library

### What I learned


```css
.mainMobile > *:not(#lower) {
  padding:0 30px;
}
```
```js
  $('elemnt').is(':hidden)
```


### Continued development

#### In future projects i would like to learn the following:

1. more resposiveness on active modes
2. when active mode activates, make better translations


### Useful resources

- [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - this acted as my cheatsheet for applying flexbox
- [mdn](https://developer.mozilla.org/) - This is helped me edit style while learning onsite to my liking so that afterwards i could just just copy and paste the coding and i wouldnt have to rewrite the application (in this case the box shadow) 
- [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) - this helped when i was looking for how to detect a non visible element using jquery
